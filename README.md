# Schedule-Planner-WPF
A WPF scheduler app used to schedule events and view how you spend your time.
I made this on my own time to help myself organize my time and tasks during school and see where I wasted the most time.
I also wanted to pose myself the challenge of learning a new language in the form of Visual Basic .NET for this project.

## Main Features

Since I built this for my own personal use I tailored these features so they would be useful to me.

- Adding an event: you can schedule events individually and sort them based off of their category.
- Next week planner: there is capability to detect when the next monday is and to allow you to schedule all your tasks up until that day.
- Day view: you can view all your events for the day like a calendar and modify them however you need.
- Monthly view: this is a calendar view of all your events for the month. You can edits events and view specific days from this view.
- Weekly time breakdown: you can view your weekly distribution of time in the form of a pie chart to see where you spent the most time.
